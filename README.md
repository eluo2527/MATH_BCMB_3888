# MATH_BCMB_3888

MATH3888.ipynb is roughly the same as the colab one except I have modified the file neames so that it can run

main.ipynb is the one I'm mainly using 

func.py is a file that stores a lot of reusable functions so write functions there and comment them

## Plan for Mid-Sem Break
1. Scott will mess around with threshold score
    - Identifying proteins that are important at multiple threshold scores
2. Patrick is implement other cluster algorithm - namely walktrap
    - Using package cdlib and exploring certain
    - Move stuff over to normal .py
    - Keep juypter for graphs
    - Optional function to save graph
3. Edward refactor code to always find connected code. Shake the code tree.
